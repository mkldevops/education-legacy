# Code Analysis and Optimization

Perform comprehensive code analysis and optimization:

1. **Analyze current changes** with `git status` and `git diff`
2. **Run code quality tools** (PHPStan, PHP CS Fixer, Rector)
3. **Review modified files** for potential improvements
4. **Identify performance bottlenecks** and optimization opportunities
5. **Apply automatic fixes** where safe
6. **Generate optimization report** with recommendations

Focus on:
- Code style and formatting issues
- Static analysis warnings
- Performance improvements
- Best practice violations
- Security vulnerabilities
- Unused imports/variables
- Refactoring opportunities
